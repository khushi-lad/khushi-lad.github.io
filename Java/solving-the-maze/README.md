# Maze Solver

## 📌 Overview
A recursive Java program that solves a maze using backtracking and visually displays the solution path.

## 🛠️ Key Features
- Recursively explores possible paths
- Uses backtracking to handle dead ends
- Visualizes the solving process step by step
- Outputs the final solution path

## 💡 Concepts Used
- Recursion
- Backtracking algorithms
- 2D arrays
- Stack-based problem solving

## ▶️ How to Run
Run the program with a maze text file as input.

## 📂 Files
- `Maze.java` – maze structure and loading
- `MazeSolver.java` – maze-solving algorithm
- `MazeVisualizer.java` – graphical visualization
- `maze1.txt`, `maze2.txt`, `maze3.txt`, `maze4.txt`, `maze5.txt` – input files to test different mazes
