# Binary Search Tree

## 📌 Overview
A Java implementation of a binary search tree supporting insertion, traversal, node counting, and height calculation.

## 🛠️ Key Features
- Insert nodes recursively
- Perform breadth-first traversal (BFS)
- Count total nodes in the tree
- Search for values in the tree

## 💡 Concepts Used
- Binary search trees
- Recursion
- Breadth-first search (BFS)
- Queues and ArrayLists

## ▶️ How to Run
Compile and run the program in a Java environment.
